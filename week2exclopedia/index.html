            <p>Pink slime is a by-product of a mechanized meat processing technique. Pink slime is also known as pink sludge, boneless lean beef trimmings, or finely textured beef. Pink slime is a filler that is used to reduce the fat content of beef-based processed meats. During production heat is used to remove the fat content of the ground beef. The product of the process, the pink slime, is then exposed to ammonia in order to kill the bacteria. Pink slime is approved for limited human consumption in the United States but it is banned for human consumption in the European Union. </p>
