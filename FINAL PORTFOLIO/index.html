            I am in my senior year of my art practices major and CTD minor. After my senior year I am planning on going into advertising. I was born and raised in Seattle Washington. One of my favorite things to do is watch movies and tv. My hobbies also include hiking, snowboarding, biking, photography, and videogames. My photography portfolio features various series of photos ranging from art photography to travel photography.
